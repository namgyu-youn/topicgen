## ðŸ“® Submitting PRs

All PRs should be submitted against `main`, and ideally should address an open issue, unless the change is small. Direct commits to main are blocked, and PRs require an approving review to merge into main. By convention, the Gradio maintainers will review PRs when:

- An initial review has been requested
- A clear, descriptive title has been assigned to the PR
- A maintainer (@namgyu-youn) is tagged in the PR comments and asked to complete a review

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to topicgen!
